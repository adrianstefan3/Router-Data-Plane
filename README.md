# Router-Data-Plane
In this project, I engineered a router data plane using C, featuring comprehensive implementations of ARP protocol functionalities and robust router operations. Additionally, I designed and integrated an efficient Longest Prefix Match (LPM) function to enhance the routing efficiency of packet traffic within the network infrastructure.
